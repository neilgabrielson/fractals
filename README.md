# Fractal Plotter

An interactive fractal visualization tool that demonstrates the beautiful relationship between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets. **[Try it live here!](https://neilgabrielson.com/fractals/)**

## Overview

This tool features side-by-side windows showing how the Mandelbrot set parameterizes Julia sets. Watch as Julia sets continuously deform when you explore the parameter space, and observe individual point iterations as they either escape to infinity or settle into cycles.

## Features

### Fractal Types
- **Mandelbrot Set** - The classic fractal
- **Cubic Multibrot** - Third-order polynomial iteration
- **Quartic Multibrot** - Fourth-order polynomial iteration  
- **Hyperbolic Mandelbrot** - Hyperbolic variant with modified norm
- **Burning Ship** - Features absolute value in the iteration

### Interactive Controls

**Navigation:**
- Click on the Mandelbrot set (left) to set the Julia set parameter `c`
- Click on the Julia set (right) to set the starting point `z`
- Zoom in/out with `+`/`-` buttons or scroll gestures
- Reset views with individual Reset buttons

**Parameter Control:**
- Lock/Unlock cursor mode - when unlocked, moving your mouse over the Mandelbrot set continuously updates the Julia set
- Manual parameter entry for precise `c` and `z` values
- Adjustable escape radius iterations (10-1000)

**Animation:**
- Single iteration step with "Iterate" button
- Continuous iteration with Play/Pause controls
- Adjustable iteration speed (10-1000ms intervals)

### Visual Customization
- **Dark Red** - Deep red gradient
- **Aqua** - Fun, blue-green palette  
- **Viridis** - My best recreation of the classic colormap

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `z`/`x` | Zoom in/out (Mandelbrot/parameter space) |
| `q`/`w` | Zoom in/out (Julia/phase space) |
| `i` | Single iteration step |
| `p` | Play/pause continuous iteration |
| `l` | Toggle cursor lock |
| `r` | Full reset |

## Mathematical Background

The fractals are generated by iterating complex functions of the form `f(z) = z^n + c` and testing for escape from a bounded region. The Mandelbrot set consists of all complex parameters `c` for which the orbit of `z = 0` remains bounded. Each point in the Mandelbrot set corresponds to a unique Julia set with that parameter value.

### Fractal Equations

- **Standard**: `f(z) = z² + c`
- **Cubic**: `f(z) = z³ + c` 
- **Quartic**: `f(z) = z⁴ + c`
- **Hyperbolic**: `f(z) = z² + c` (with Hyperbolic/Split-Complex Numbers)
- **Burning Ship**: `f(z) = (|Re(z)| + i|Im(z)|)² + c` (Just like the Mandelbrot, but you take the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts for each iteration)

## Usage Tips

1. **Exploring**: Unlock your cursor and pan around the mandelbrot set to see the Julia sets continuously deform!
2. **Zooming**: Use the keyboard shortcuts or control panel buttons to adjust the window!
3. **Iterations**: Watch points in the Julia set either escape or approach a cycle by iterating on them repeatedly or playing automatic iterations!
4. **Performance**: Adjust iteration count or the escape criterion to speed up rendering while exploring or increase detail when zoomed in!
